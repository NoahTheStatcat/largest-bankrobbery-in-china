april 14, 2007.
on a day quiet like no other 2 vault managers start scheming.
 Ren Xiaofeng, stole 200,000 yuan (c. US$26,000) in October 2006 with the complicity of two security guards, Zhao Xuenan and Zhang Qiang. Ren then purchased tickets for the Chinese
 lottery, with the intention of winning a sufficiently large prize that he could return the missing funds before their absence was noted, and still have money left over for himself.
Despite the odds, Ren was successful, and he was able to return the 200,000 to the vault.

success came with malicious intent.
his odds being very successful, and his maxed level in luck, he was ready to hit the big leagues.

Ren joined forces with another manager, Ma Xiangjing.

he would not know what was a-foot of this robbery.
during march and april in 2007, both ren and ma xiangjing started planning on how to refine the old plan of 200,000 stolen yaun.
they soon started strategizing looking for more money to smother china's funding.
soon they got to the actual bank robbery, holding a stealthy wealthy amount of 32.96 million yaun
they almost lost 31.25 million buying lottery tickets, failing and repeating, things where looking down for these rogues.

they felt desperate, they where deeply low on cash, they where ready for another hit and run.
they hit up the same bank, but this time 6 cash boxes, all containing enough for them to stay low for a while.
the amount they stole that day, 18 million yaun.
sure, they might have stolen the towns money that china had specifically locked up, somehow these people stealthily stole 3 times with no error.
but little did they know they where not out of the waters yet...

in april 14 spending stolen profits on more lottery tickets,
these lottery tickets got recorded and saved, they had names for 98,000 yaun.
they where noticed, but no legal action was made, who knew who stole half of their vault.
afterall china didn't know what happened in 1989 tiananmen square.
heck i don't even know.

2 days after the robbery, the two's relationship was arising, but their crimes where not getting unnoticed.
the guy that recorded the lottery tickets had reported them to the authorities.
little did they know, their debt would be knocking on their door.
ma and ren decided to use most of their earnings to escape out of china, they bought 2 fake id's and changed their identity.
this resulted in extentive search for the two, as they where more than criminals, they had 5 stars, an extensive search is worrying the two.

it's april 18th, ma and ren split up going their different ways, knowing if they turn back to their regular lives, they cannot escape unscaved.
ma, caught in bejing and arrested by law enforcement, they try getting information on ren's where-abouts.
soon later ren was getting knocks on his door left in right, in his head he might have been thinking it was his neighbors down the street trying to sell the latest
hit product.
interested he opened the door. he would soon be greeted by cops. ren was found in Lianyungang, a coastal town in Jiangsu Province.
the manhunt was finished, they found the recorded criminals and got sent to jail for embezzlement of the bank.
 the security guards, were charged with misappropriating public funds. A fifth man, Song Changhai, was also prosecuted for sheltering a criminal, Ma, while he was on the run from law enforcement.
The three accomplices were all given sentences of up to five years in prison, while the two managers were sentenced to death.
A landlord, a cab driver, and a car saleswoman in Lianyungang shared a 200,000 yuan reward for assisting police to arrest Ren, while in Handan five employees of the bank were fired.
the other money they owed from gambling was somewhat recovered by police, 5.5 million yaun almost 1/5th of what they embezzled.

after ma and ren's journey they where soon to knock on deaths door.
Both Ren and Ma were executed in Hebei province on April 1, 2008. As criminals, their bodies were cremated and the ashes thrown into the Yellow Sea by the Chinese Police.
A good ending, but not one for ma and ren. some still say they just need one eye to beat the end.
